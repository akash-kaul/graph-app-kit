# Amazon Neptune setup and graph-app-kit configuration

[Amazon Neptune](https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/) is a &quot;fast, reliable, fully managed graph database service that makes it easy to build and run applications that work with highly connected datasetsa&quot;. It supports both property graph queries with [Apache Gremlin/Tinkerpop](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/) queries, and RDF graphs with SPAQL queries.

## 1. Setup Amazon Neptune


### Option: Manual

Ensure your Amazon Neptune database instance can be connected to by your `graph-app-kit` instance:

- You must have or create an Amazon Neptune cluster. See the official [Getting Started with Neptune docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/get-started.html).

- Amazon Neptune clusters are hosted in a private VPC so the server hosting `graph-app-kit` must be [granted access to the VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/security-vpc.html). We strongly recommend hosting the `graph-app-kit` instance in a public subnet within the Neptune database's VPC. Alternatively, with (much) more configuration, you can try VPC peering between subnets, with communication opened for port 8182 on the Neptune IP, and all ideally running in the same availability zone.

- If using IAM authorization on your Amazon Neptune cluster the sample code provided will need to be updated to support using SigV4 signing of requests. We recommend using [this tool](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-neptune-tools/tree/master/neptune-python-utils) to simplify the process.

### Option: Quick launch prepopulated Customer Identity Graph database

Quick launch the customer identity graph database using the [identity graph sample cloud formation templates](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/building-a-customer-identity-graph-with-amazon-neptune/):

1. Click `Launch Stack` button for your region. If using GPUs, ensure it is a region where you have GPU quota.
2. Check the acknowledgement boxes in the `Capabilities` section
3. Click `Create Stack` (5-20min)
4. The root `Identity-Graph-Sample` item's `Output` tab will show values used to configure the next steps:

  * `VPC` ID
  * `PublicSubnet1`: Inspecting the AWS Console (`Services` -> `VPC` -> `Subnets`) should report `Auto-assign public IPv4 address: Yes `.

You can always return to this screen by `Services` -> `CloudFormation` -> `Stacks` . It enables you to inspect the generated stack as well as use the `delete` button to safely remove any resources generated by this step.

## 2. Launch graph-app-kit for Amazon Neptune

Create an AWS EC2 `graph-app-kit` instance using the usual [graph-app-kit first launch step](steps.md), with the following launch settings:

  1. Set `Network` to the `VPC` ID value ("`vpc-...`") from `1. Setup Amazon Neptune` (unless performing an alternative like manual VPC peering)
  2. Set `Subnet` to the `PublicSubnet1` subnet ID value ("`subnet-...`") from `1. Setup Amazon Neptune`
      * `Auto-assign Public IP` should default to `Use subnet setting (Enable)`

Continue through the [graph-app-kit steps to download and build](steps.md).


## 3. Configure graph-app-kit 

SSH into your `graph-app-kit` instance and set the following required environment variable configurations in your [src/docker/.env](src/docker/.env) file:

```bash
NEPTUNE_READER_PROTOCOL=wss
NEPTUNE_READER_HOST=<Insert Neptune DBClusterReadEndpoint like abc.xyz.mno.neptune.amazonaws.com>
NEPTUNE_READER_PORT=8182
```

For additional template options, see [src/envs/neptune.env](src/envs/neptune.env).

Reset and restart your `graph-app-kit` container: 

```bash
cd src/docker
sudo docker-compose down -v
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

Watch logs with `sudo docker-compose logs -f -t --tail=1`

## 4. Graph!

* Go to http://your.public.ip.address:8501: A demo StreamLit + Graphistry dashboard should load
* Select `GREMLIN: SIMPLE SAMPLE` from the dropdown to load a random sample of nodes from whatever Neptune database is connected
* Continue to the instructions for [creating custom views](views.md) and [adding common extensions](extend.md) like TLS, public/private dashboards, and more


## Advanced: Local Developement

As Amazon Neptune runs in a private VPC, it exposes no internet-accessible API endpoints, so local development requires additional steps. Options to connect to Amazon Neptune from a local computer include:

* Setup an SSH tunnel for your internet connections

* Configure a load balancer to expose the Neptune endpoint

* Choose another way to configure secure access to a private VPC in AWS.
